<p>   Hi. My name is Megan Leigh Rocha, and I'm from Fresno, California. My birthday is December 13, 2002. Fun fact, I was born on Friday the 13th. Spooky huh. I kind offeel like I'm cursed. I'm the middle child and I'm left handed. My favorite colors are green, pastel purple, and pink. I like plants and I collect clowns. They make me happy.</p>
 <p> I love going thrifting and antiquing. Some things I hate are eggs, the color red, and loud people. I'm quiet and I keep to myself. I'm pretty shy and seem kind of mean, but I'm not.</p>
